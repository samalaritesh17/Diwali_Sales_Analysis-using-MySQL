Hi,
I did an analysis project on Diwali Sales dataset using MySQL.
•	Utilized MySQL and conducted comprehensive analysis of Diwali sales data to identify trends and patterns.
•	Transformed and filtered data by using aggregating and filtering functions to improve the reporting process.
•	Employed various statistical techniques to derive actionable insights from the data.
